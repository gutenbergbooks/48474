    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA MOLOOF. A Greek girl and a dancer. Speaks perfect English, but
      withal has that slight, indefinable foreign touch of accent. Good figure,
      willowy, yet not too slender. Of indeterminate age, possibly no more than
      twenty-five. Her furs the most magnificent in all the Yukon country from
      Chilcoot to St. Michael's, her name common on the lips of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      FLOYD VANDERLIP. An Eldorado king, worth a couple of millions. Simple,
      elemental, almost childish in his emotions. But a brave man, and
      masculine; a man who has done a man's work in the world. Has caressed more
      shovel-handles than women's hands. Big-muscled, big-bodied,
      ingenuous-faced; the sort of a man whom women of the right sort can tie
      into knots.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORAINE LISZNAYI. A Hungarian, reputed to be wealthy, and to be travelling
      in the Klondike for pleasure and love of adventure. Past the flush of
      youth, and with fair success feigning youth. In the first stages of
      putting flesh upon her erstwhile plumpness. Dark-eyed, a flashing,
      dazzling brunette, with a cosmopolitan reputation earned in a day when she
      posed in the studios of artist-queens and received at her door the cards
      of cardinals and princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN EPPINGWELL. Special agent for the United States government.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. EPPINGWELL. His wife. Twenty-five to twenty-eight years of age. Of
      the cold order of women, possessing sanity, and restraint, and control.
      Brown hair, demi-blond type, oval-faced, with cameo-like features. The
      kind of a woman who is not painfully good, but who acts upon principle and
      who knows always just what she is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FLOSSIE. Eighteen or nineteen years of age. Of the soft and clinging kind,
      with pretty, pouting lips, blow-away hair, and eyes full of the merry
      shallows of life. Engaged to marry Floyd Vanderlip.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRINCE. A young mining engineer. A good fellow, a man's man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MCFEE. Near to forty, Scotch accent, sharp-featured, and unbeautiful,
      with an eager nose that leads her into the affairs of others. So painfully
      good that it hurts.
    </p>
    <p>
      SITKA CHARLEY. An Indian dog-puncher, who has come into the warm and sat
      by the fires of the white man until he is somewhat as one of them. Should
      not be much shorter than Vanderlip and Captain Eppingwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAVE HARNEY. An Eldorado king, also a Yankee, with a fondness for sugar
      and a faculty for sharp dealing. Is tall, lean, loose-jointed. Walks with
      a shambling gait. Speaks slowly, with a drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      MINNIE. <i>(Maid to Freda.)</i> A cool, impassive young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      POLICEMAN. A young fellow, with small blond mustache. An Englishman,
      brave, cool, but easily embarrassed. Though he says "Sorry" frequently, he
      is never for an instant afraid.

    <h2>
      ACT I&mdash;ALASKA COMPANY'S STORE AT DAWSON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scene. <i>Alaska Commercial Company's store at Dawson. It is eleven
      o'clock of a cold winter morning. In front, on the left, a very large
      wood-burning stove. Beside the stove is a woodbox filled with firewood.
      Farther back, on left, a door with sign on it, "Private." On right, door,
      a street entrance; alongside are wisp-brooms for brushing snow from
      moccasins. In the background a long counter running full length of room
      with just space at either end for ingress or egress. Large gold-scales
      rest upon counter. Behind counter equally long rows of shelves, broken in
      two places by ordinary small-paned house-windows. Windows are source of a
      dim, gray light. Doors, window-frames, and sashes are of rough, unstained
      pine boards. Shelves practically empty, with here and there upon them an
      article of hardware </i>(such as pots, pans, and tea-kettles)<i>, or of
      dry-goods </i>(such as pasteboard boxes and bolts of cloth)<i>. The walls
      of the store are of logs stuffed between with brown moss. On counter,
      furs, moccasins, mittens, and blankets, piled up or spread out for
      inspection. In front of counter many snow-shoes, picks, shovels, axes,
      gold-pans, axe-handles, and oblong sheet-iron Yukon stoves. The feature
      most notable is the absence of foodstuffs in any considerable quantity. On
      shelves a few tins of mushrooms, a few bottles of olives.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>About the stove, backs to the stove and hands behind their backs, clad
      in mackinaw suits, mittens dangling from around their necks at ends of
      leather thongs, ear-flaps of fur caps raised, are several miners.</i>
      Prince <i>stands by stove An Indian is replenishing the fire with great
      chunks of wood. Mounted police pass in and out.</i> Sitka Charley <i>is
      examining snow-shoes, bending and testing them. Behind the counter are
      several clerks, one of whom is waiting upon a bearded miner near end of
      counter to right.</i>

    <p>
      <i>(Shakes head as before.)</i>

    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(Supreme pathos.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No sugar?
    </p>
    <h4>
      CLERK
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(Coming from behind counter and approaching stove, visibly irritated,
      shaking his head violently; midway he encounters Miner, who retreats
      backward before him.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No! No! No! I tell you no! No flour, no beans, no sugar, nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Warms his hands over stove and glares ferociously at Miner.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Dave Harney enters from right, brushes snow from moccasins, and walks
      across to stove. He is tall and lean, has a loose-jointed, shambling gait,
      and listens interestedly to Clerk and Miner. He evinces a desire to speak,
      but his mustached mouth is so iced-up that he cannot open it. He bends
      over stove to thaw the ice.)</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      MINER
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(To Clerk, with growing anger.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's all very well for your playing the high an' lofty, you sneakin'
      little counter-jumper. But we all know what your damned Company is up to.
      You're holdin' grub for a rise, that's what you're doin'. Famine prices is
      your game.
    </p>
    <h4>
      CLERK
    </h4>
    <p>
      Look at the shelves, man! Look at them!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MINER
    </h4>
    <p>
      How about the warehouses, eh? Stacked to the roof with grub!
    </p>
    <h4>
      CLERK
    </h4>
    <p>
      They're not.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MINER
    </h4>
    <p>
      I suppose you'll say they're empty.
    </p>
    <h4>
      CLERK
    </h4>
    <p>
      They're not. But what little grub's in them belongs to the sour-doughs who
      filed their orders last spring and summer before ever you thought of
      coming into the country. And even the sourdoughs are scaled down, cut
      clean in half. Now shut up. I don't want to hear any more from you. You
      newcomers needn't think you're going to run this country, because you
      ain't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Turning his hack on Miner.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Damned cheechawker!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MINER
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(Breaking down and showing fear, not of Clerk, but of famine.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But good heavens, man, what am I to do? I haven't fifty pounds of flour
      for the whole winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can pay for my grub if you'll sell it to me. You can't leave me starve!
    </p>
    <h4>
      DAVE HARNEY
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(Tearing the last chunk oj ice from mustache and sending it rattling to
      the floor. He speaks with a drawl.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Aw, you tenderfeet make me tired. I never seen the beat of you critters.
      Better men than you have starved in this country, an' they didn't make no
      bones about it neither&mdash;they was all bones I calkilate. What do you
      think this is? A Sunday picnic? Jes' come in, eh? An' you're clean scairt.
      Look at me&mdash;old-timer, sir, a sour-dough, an' proud of it! I come
      into this country before there was any blamed Company, fished for my
      breakfast, an' hunted my supper. An' when the fish didn't bite an' they
      wa'n't any game, jes' cinched my belt tighter an' hiked along, livin' on
      salmon-bellies and rabbit tracks an' eatin' my moccasins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Jubilantly.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I tell you this is the country that'll take the saleratus out of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Miner, awed by being face to face with an old-timer, withers up during
      harangue, and at finish shrinks behind other miners, and from there makes
      exit to right.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Drawing paper from pocket and presenting it.)</i>

    </p>
    <h4>

      honest bodies must be so sore put. There'll be ruffians and gamblers with
      masks over their sinful faces, and who's to know? And there's that Freda
      woman. 'Tis said she plays with the souls of men as a child with a wee bit

    <h4>

      O-o-h!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. EPPINGWELL
    </h4>
    <p>
      Floyd Vanderlip is a big, strong man. For five years he chased Eldorados
      over the ice-fields, living on moose and salmon and working like a beast.
      He never had an idle moment in which to be wicked. Then he struck it on
      Klondike and is worth millions and millions. Also, he sat down for the
      first time in five years and rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered a girl who was waiting for him down in the States&mdash;a
      young thing&mdash;and sent for her to come in. They were to be married as
      soon as she arrived. He has a cabin all ready. Well, that's Flossie. She
      is coming in over the ice now&mdash;he's told me all about it&mdash;and
      ought to be here any day. I've been looking for her, and looking for her,
      till I am almost sick. Then this Freda Moloof cast her spell upon him. I
      heard the gossip&mdash;
    </p>
    <h4>
      CAPT. EPPINGWELL
    </h4>
    <p>
      And proceeded to take a hand. I begin to understand.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. EPPINGWELL
    </h4>
    <p>
      I did my best to break her influence. The time and thought I've wasted
      upon that man! It's almost scandalous the way I've devoted myself to him!
      Sitka Charley believes I am in love with him&mdash;told me so to my face.
      And it's all wasted, card parties and everything. What was I against the
      only woman in Klondike who possesses a piano and a maid? And to-night he
      runs away down the river with her.
    </p>
    <h4>

      appeal to. To try to impress him to do the right thing would be like
      setting fire to a powder mill. I wish I knew how near Flossie is. There
      hasn't been a courier or a mail carrier in for weeks and weeks. The mail

      I talked with the dog-puncher. He said they'd camp to-night at Mooseback
      and come in tomorrow. That's twenty-five miles, and if they don't start
      too late, they'll make Dawson by the middle of the day.

    <p>
      Oh, one of the soft and clingy kind, I guess I'd call her. You know, the
      kind that needs lots of cuddling and petting. Pretty, yes, danged pretty.
      Blue eyes, wavy hair, and all the rest&mdash;trembly lips and teary eyes&mdash;smily
      and weepy, you know, all in the same moment. But, gee! Freda, I can't
      stand here gassin' all day. I got about a thousand dollars' worth of
      letters to deliver&mdash;a dollar apiece and cheap at the price. I'll see
      you later. So long.

      Now this little girl is coming in over the ice&mdash;her name is Flossie.
      She has lived a soft life down in California, where the sun is warm and
      there is no snow. She does not know hardship, nor the trail, and she is
      having a hard time now on the trail. Think of it!&mdash;sixty-five degrees
      below zero this morning, and she is out in it, walking, walking, walking,
      her breath freezing, her mouth icing up, her eyebrows rimed with frost.
      And she is very stiff, and sore, and tired. Every step of the trail she
      takes in pain. It is like a bad dream to her, Charley. But she sees,
      always before her, at the end of the dream, an awakening at Dawson, in the
      arms of the man who is to marry her. But, Charley, what if when she gets
      to Dawson there is no Floyd Vanderlip? no man to marry her? It will break
      her heart. It will be no happy awakening from a bad dream, but the
      beginning of a worse dream. And she is a little girl, Charley&mdash;not a
      strong woman like me who does not care. She will care, and she will know
      nobody, and she will cry, and cry, and cry. Did you ever hear a woman cry,
      Charley? Think of it, she is only a little girl.

    </p>
    <p>
      They say she is a rich woman in her own country. But I don't believe it. I
      think she is after Vanderlip's money.

    <h4>

    <p>
      Lisznayi woman no got money. I know. I sell her dogs&mdash;eight hundred
      dollars. She pay me three hundred. Two weeks, three weeks, I no get other
      five hundred dollars. Um no got five hundred. I say, "My dogs, give me
      back." She give back. Me have fur robe. Good fur robe. She buy, two
      hundred dollar. Um no pay. Um have good fur robe. Me no have nothing. Um
      have cabin. Um no pay rent to Johnson. Um smile very nice, um Johnson
      wait. I know, I see. Um dogs she got now, Vanderlip give, make present. Um
      no pay firewood. Um no pay many things.

    <h4>
      FREDA
    </h4>
    <p>
      I thought so. And now to win the race. Dogs first of all. Flossie must be
      brought in to-night. I want you here in Dawson, Charley. So you must send
      some Indian up the trail with a fresh team of dogs. Flossie camps at
      Mooseback tonight. He is to let her think that Vanderlip has sent the
      dogs, and that Vanderlip wants her to come right on to-night. Understand?
    </p>
    <h4>
      SITKA CHARLEY
    </h4>

      Um. Sure.

    <p>
      <i>(Preparing to start toward door at right.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Start the dogs right away with a man you can trust. And he must be sure to
      let Flossie think that Vanderlip sent him. At the best, Flossie can't
      arrive until late to-night. And there may be delays. You keep on
      Vanderlip's trail so that you will know always where he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Freda and Sitka Charley start to walk toward the door at right.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I send for him you must bring him to me, and I'll hold him till
      Flossie gets in.

    </p>
    <h4>

    <p>
      But she camps at Mooseback.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. EPPINGWELL
    </h4>
    <p>
      There are dogs in Dawson. Now, Archie, this is for you to do. Borrow a
      team of fresh dogs somewhere, put your Indian in charge of it, that
      one-eyed man, he's faithful, and start him up the trail to Flossie. Let
      her think Floyd Vanderlip has sent the dogs to bring her in right away.

      And once Flossie is here and gets her arms around Floyd Vanderlip's neck,
      Freda Moloof will wait in vain at the water-hole.
    </p>
    <h4>
      CAPT. EPPINGWELL
    </h4>
    <p>
      That will settle it. Freda's not the woman to stand knocking her feet
      around a water-hole very long for any man.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. EPPINGWELL

      I know enough about her, when it comes to Vanderlip and Flossie, to think
      her the best of the boiling... and to have a sneaking regret for her being
      beaten this way.

    <h4>

    <p>
      Floyd Vanderlip is coming to the ball. I'll see that he comes. I'll be
      very nice to him and watch him closely so that he does not sneak away. If
      Flossie fails to arrive, say by half-past eleven, I'll be taken ill, and
      I'll ask Vanderlip to take me home; and I'll hold him, no matter how
      terribly ill or terribly nice I have to be, until midnight is well past or
      until Flossie arrives.
    </p>
    <h4>

      ACT II&mdash;ANTEROOM OF PIONEER HALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scene. <i>Anteroom of Pioneer Hall. It is ten-thirty P.M. The room is
      large and bare. Its walls are of logs, stuffed between with brown moss.
      Street door to rear, in centre. Doors, window-frames, and sashes of rough,
      unstained pine boards. At one side of door is wisp-broom for brushing snow
      from moccasins. On either side of door is an ordinary small-paned window,
      and beneath either window is a rough wooden bench. Under benches are large
      out-door moccasins, left there after the manner of overshoes, by their
      owners. In available space on rear wall, many wooden pegs, on which are
      hanging furs, parkas, hats, wraps, etc. Midway between front and rear, and
      at equal distances between centre and sides, running at full blast, are
      two large wood-burning stoves. Alongside each stove is a wood-box filled
      with firewood. On right, a window. On left, wide doorway, open, connecting
      with ballroom. Through doorway come occasional snatches of dance-music,
      bursts of laughter and of voices. Because it is very cold, street door is
      kept closed, and is opened by doorkeeper only when some one knocks, and
      then only long enough for that one to enter. All parleying is done on
      inside with door closed. Prince, as doorkeeper, is standing at rear by
      street door. Men and women, in costume, are disappearing through door to
      left, from where come strains of a waltz.</i>

      should like. You do waltz so well, Mr. Vanderlip.

      I won't be able to make that waltz, I&mdash;<i>(Breaks off suddenly.)</i>

    <h4>
      MRS. EPPINGWELL

      Why, you, of all men, are not going home early?

      of his difficulty.)</i>

      Why, yes, of course we can have that waltz together. I thought it was
      already engaged, that was all.

    </p>
    <h4>

    <p>
      Half of them. They, will butt in, and I have to turn them away. Oh, it's
      hospitality, you bet. I've been with them on trail, I've eaten their food
      and slept in their blankets, and now I turn them away from the merrymaking
      of myself and my friends.

      under bench close to door. She removes cloak, and reveals herself in a
      striking evening gown. As she turns her back to hang cloak on wall, Prince
      happens to see her. She starts toward ballroom, but he steps in her way
      and stops her.)</i>

    <p>
      I have been made sorry by more than one face I've seen to-night and turned
      away from the door.
    </p>
    <h4>
      FREDA
    </h4>
    <p>
      But in my case you will be sorry for quite a different reason.

    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(Curiously.)</i>

      For what reason, then, pray?
    </p>
    <h4>
      FREDA
    </h4>
    <p>
      Because, after seeing my face, you will not turn me away.

    <h4>
      PRINCE
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(With certitude.)</i>
    </p>

      Then there will be no reason for me to turn you away.
    </p>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      On the contrary, all the reason in the world. But you won't.

      it opened the frost came through, in a cloud of vapor, rolling along the
      floor and hiding the feet and legs of the dancers to the knees. And we

      ACT III&mdash;FREDA MOLOOF'S CABIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scene. <i>Freda Moloofs cabin. It is eleven forty-five at night. The room
      is large, and luxuriously furnished. Its walls are of logs stuffed between
      with brown moss. Doors of rough, unstained pine boards, also window-frames
      and sashes. Street door to rear, in centre. On either side of door is an
      ordinary, small-paned window. To left of door a plain chair. On rear wall,
      near door, are wooden pegs, from which hang cloaks, wraps, furs, etc.,
      also wisp-brooms for brushing snow from moccasins.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The luxury of furnishing is of the solid order. No gim-cracks, no
      bric-a-brac. Furniture is rough, made in the Klondike. Tables, chairs,
      etc., are unpolished; they are made from pine lumber, are unstained,
      rough, massive. There is no carpet. Bearskins, etc., litter the floor.
      Strange juxtaposition of rough pine furniture, costly rugs, etc.; and,
      strangest of all, a grand piano. The cheapest and simplest and ugliest of
      kerosene lamps are used for lighting purposes, also candles. On walls are
      magnificent moose-horns and other appropriate trophies and weapons of the
      Northland </i>(such as great ivory-headed spears and a pair of tusks of
      the mammoth)<i>; but there are no framed paintings.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Midway between front and rear, and midway between centre and right, a
      large, wood-burning stove. Beside it a woodbox. On stove a tea-kettle is
      simmering. To left of stove, and near it, table, with table-cover on it, a
      few books and magazines, and a cheap kerosene lamp; around table several
      pine chairs. Between table and stove two easy chairs of rough pine,
      massive, thrown over with furs. On right, at front, against wall, a large,
      comfortable lounging-couch with many cushions. On left, at front, a grand
      piano. On piano a small, gilt French clock is ticking.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The room is luxurious, comfortable, picturesque, emphasizing the
      contact of civilization and the wilderness. In short, it is the best
      possible living apartment that money can purchase in the Klondike.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A Maid is in easy chair, reading magazine and yawning. Door opens on
      right. Indian enters with armful of firewood, which he carries to stove
      and dumps in woodbox. He proceeds to put several sticks of wood into stave
      and to adjust damper. His entrance arouses Maid, who looks up, yawns, lays
      magazine face-down on lap, yawns again, at same time stretching arms
      behind head, and glances at clock. It is quite a distance to clock. She
      rubs eyes and looks again.</i>

      Well, I had a hankering after them myself, till I got to thinking a while
      back, and I've about sized it up that one gets fat living in palaces, and
      soft and lazy. No sir, no champagne on tap and soft summer skies for me.

    <h4>
      FREDA

    <p>
      I suppose it's nice in palaces&mdash;for a time. But one would soon tire.
      The world is good, but life should be many-sided. The way we'll do it will
      be to rough and knock about for a while, and then rest up somewhere.

      Look here, Freda, I'm a fool. I know it. I was a fool there in that chair.
      You put it all over me. You women all make a fool of me. I don't think
      quick. I'm not used to it, I guess. My tongue is awkward. I can't think of
      bright things to say, or the right things to say. And I believe what is
      said to me. And then I like women, too. I can't help it. I was born that
      way. I just like them, and they take advantage of me&mdash;

      Because I am a fool. Because I am playing their game and don't know how to
      play it. They know how to play it. They ought to know&mdash;it is their
      game. A man's a fool to buck another man's game. The percentage is all in
      favor of the house. And a man is a bigger fool to buck a woman's game. And
      I've been dead soft and easy. I know it. I've played your game and you've

      When you came against me and rested your head on my breast so that the
      scent of your hair got into my brain and maddened me, you lied to me. You
